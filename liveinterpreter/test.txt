#SPIN Version: 1.2

#Updated version of the 1.0 version of addTwoNumbers
#Has the same functionality and limitations, just uses new loop syntax
#Is much shorter and uses fewer SPINs, so should be much faster as well

SPIN # [1]
L.in # L = X
R.in # R = Y
L.write # [1] = X
(.R # using R, because if Y is 0 we don't want to subtract anything
L.sub
R.sub
).R
# L = X-Y, R = 0
R.read # R = X
R.dub # R = 2X
(.L # using L, because if X-Y is 0 we don't want to subtract anything
R.sub
L.sub
).L
# R = (2X) - (X-Y)
R.out
